For poster
1) performance: parallelization vs combination
2) demo: synthesize, counterexample, highlight
3) compare with rishabh's tool (when his doesn't work)

cuong:
- # of symbolic variables = # of holes
- generalize # of fixes
- multIA += -> *=
- test preserveMutator
- add generic mutator

mangpo:
- for
- return in loop, break

===== python to racket ====
- quotient or /
- base case
- for

======================================
EXAMPLE for synthesis
hw1-2, hw2-1, hw2-2 (tweak)
hw1-4 (hailstone)

======================================
ComputeDeriv
1: ok
2: base case
3: list comprehension
4: base case
EvaluatePoly
1: no return, break
2: ok
3: ok with > => !=
4: ok
OddTuples
1: ok with range(l) => range(len(l))
2: ok
MultIA
1: ok
2: base case, add statement
